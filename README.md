# 💊 Serendipitous Drug Prediction using CNN

This project explores a deep learning approach to **predict drug-target interactions** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It demonstrates how molecular descriptor data can be used to identify potential drug candidates in a *serendipitous* (unexpected but effective) way — supporting drug repurposing and accelerating early-stage discovery.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Develop a binary classification model to predict interaction (binds/doesn’t bind)
- Use a CNN to learn patterns from structured molecular descriptors
- Explore an application of AI in **biomedical and pharmaceutical domains**
- Provide a clear, reproducible workflow for future extension to real-world datasets

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas, NumPy**
- **matplotlib, seaborn**
- Google Colab (for training)
